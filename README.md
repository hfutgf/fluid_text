# FluidText

FluidText is a real-time online editor built on the MERN stack, using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the backend and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend. The project is organized as a monorepo using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/).

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Edit documents collaboratively using WebSockets.
- **Code Quality Enforcement:** Automatically run ESLint and Prettier via Husky hooks.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separate frontend and backend for easier development and scalability.
- **Fast Builds:** Leverage TurboRepo for efficient builds and development.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm
- Git

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/fluid_text.git

pnpm dev
Building the Project
To build all packages (both frontend and backend) in the monorepo, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm -r run build
Linting and Formatting
Before committing, Husky automatically runs ESLint and Prettier to enforce code quality.

Edit
pnpm eslint . --fix
pnpm prettier --write .
